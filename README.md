# Packer Desktop

## Summary

This build configuration installs the `vagrant-desktop` environments onto minimal ubuntu images that can be used with Virtualbox.

## Getting Started

Make sure all the required software (listed above) is installed, then you can build the images as follows:

```bash
# cd x11/
# cd opengl/
# cd base/
packer build ubuntu.json
```

After a few minutes, Packer should tell you the image was generated successfully.
